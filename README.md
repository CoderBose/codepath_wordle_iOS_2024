# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Priyanka Bose

Wordle is an app that allows users to guess words. Words are randomly generated and users can try to guess the alphabets. If the alphabet is present in the word, it's highligted in yellow. If it is present in the word, at the correct position, it gets highligted in green.

## Notes

Uploading the final submission to github gave me a really tough time. I tried to clone the repo, even tried to upload the files in a new repo, but even that was failing.

Other than that, not challenging, but I like documentation and hence reading the API docs was kinda fun. I could play around with the different methods and parameters, never having used Swift before.
